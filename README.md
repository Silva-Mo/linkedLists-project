# Fibonacci & Merge Sort

## About

This is a JavaScript project from **The Odin Project** curriculum — implementing **iterative and recursive Fibonacci** functions, along with a **recursive Merge Sort**.

Alhamdulillah

## What was needed to complete it:

- Writing iterative and recursive Fibonacci functions
- Building a recursive Merge Sort function
- Testing edge cases and different inputs

## Challenges that I’ve overcome:

- Understanding recursion flow in Fibonacci
- Handling array splitting and merging in Merge Sort
- Making sure the functions work for various input sizes

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js (for testing)
