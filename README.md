# Linked Lists

## About

This is a JavaScript project from **The Odin Project** curriculum — implementing a **custom Linked List** with essential methods such as appending, prepending, searching, and removing nodes.

Alhamdulillah

## What was needed to complete it:

- Building a `Node` class to represent list elements
- Building a `LinkedList` class to manage nodes
- Implementing core methods:
  - `append(value)`
  - `prepend(value)`
  - `size()`
  - `head()`
  - `tail()`
  - `at(index)`
  - `pop()`
  - `contains(value)`
  - `find(value)`
  - `toString()`
- Testing edge cases and different operations

## Challenges that I’ve overcome:

- Understanding how nodes link together
- Traversing the list without built-in array methods
- Handling edge cases like empty lists or invalid indices
- Ensuring all methods return correct results consistently

## Tech Stack

- JavaScript (ES6)
- Node.js (for testing)
